# Forest Fire Detection using DL
A deep-learning notebook for detecting forest fires from image data.

## Overview
This project uses a convolutional neural network to classify images for the presence of forest fires. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manvip28/forest_fire_detection_using_dl.git
   cd forest_fire_detection_using_dl
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Forest_Fire_Detection_using_DL.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model.
